# PersonalityTransactionNotifications
A very basic set of custom personalities to notify you of your bank balance after a transaction

This code snippet is meant to plugin to the root code for their banking api
When you make a transaction and want to be notified of your balance these functions return a message that can be used with the sms, email or push notifications that come with the root banking api. 

Each function represents a different personality this being;

My personal one
A posh butler
An Aussie
A strong independent woman! whoow (Little bit vulgar)

Please feel free to alter the balance ranges to suite your own interests and if you have any more personalities ideas please contribute
